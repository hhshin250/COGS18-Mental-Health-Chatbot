    "Have you every found yourself struggling with mental health or finding mental health resources avaliable to you? For my project, I decided to create a chatbot that will assist you in finding the right mental health resources and give you helpful mental health suggestions depending on your current situation. The chatbot can output random mental health suggestions as well as information about a disorder you are suffering from and open a youtube video for strategies to deal with panic attacks.\n",

    "Before taking this class I had little knowledge about java but have never had actual coding experience in a project. I feel that I included many different scenarios that the chatbot could produce, including 4 mental health disorders and 3 services (outputting suggestions, positive affirmations, and playing a breahting exercise video) the chatbot could perform that made my chatbot more extensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it's not the most complex chatbot, I still challenged myself to learn code outside of this class by implementing IFrame into my code in order to embed a youtube video. Some of the challenges that I faced while trying to do this was that I initially tried to use webbrowser to embed the video but the video had difficulty appearing so I looked for additional methods to try and play the video. I also learned about different ways of embeding the video including HTML and IFrame. This project was one of my most time consuming finals this quarter because of how new I was to coding but I'm glad I took on the challenge and I'm proud of how it turned out. Thank you for the quarter and thank you to TA Sabrina for all the valuable feedback that helped me learn and improve my code!"
